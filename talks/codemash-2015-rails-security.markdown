title: Basics of Rails Security
---
<br>

Modern web apps, like those written in Rails, are typically vulnerable to a number of common attacks. OWASP publishes a list of the top ten most common vulnerabilities, but it's not enough to simply protect against those and be done. You have to focus on the key vulnerable spots in your application as it's being written.

Presented at CodeMash v2.0.1.5. The title was changed from **What to Say When They Ask About Security** to **Basics of Rails App Security**, because the original title was really lame.
