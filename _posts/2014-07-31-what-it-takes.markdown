[Matt Darby](http://matt-darby.com) was recently asked what it takes to start a career in software development, and put together [a thoughtful response](http://blog.matt-darby.com/essays/what-it-takes). I think these are some really interesting questions, so I <strike>shamelessly stole</strike> took inspiration.

### How good do you have to be?

"Good enough" is the vague answer, but this is a vague question. I'd say at a minimum this implies two things: one, that you *know how to find answers*. If I ask you to do something you've never done before (design a UI, write some SQL, run some business logic asynchronously in the background, whatever), you should at least be able to start researching how to do it.

Secondly, *be better than you were yesterday*. I've met a good number of folks who've learned enough Rails to get off the ground and stopped there. It's cool that you can use Rails scaffolding to get a basic CRUD app built, but there's a world of things to learn beyond that.

### What is expected?

If you want a job doing web development, doing a CRUD webapp top to bottom is table stakes. This absolutely means:

* HTML and CSS, because it's a web app
* SQL for storing data in a database
* Ruby and Rails (or some other framework or language)

That's the bare minimum. If I'm hiring a professional web developer, I'd also expect knowledge on:

* Automated testing with something like RSpec
* Version control with Git
* Javascript, at least enough to use JQuery

No mastery necessary, but definitely have a working knowledge. I'm not great with CSS, but I know enough to get by, and I know how to learn more.

### How did you get your first job?

I was persistent!

I saw a job ad on Craigslist that I liked -- no joke, it said that they bought lunch for all employees, every day. That was enough to hook me. I read their list of requirements, figured I met all the bullet points enough that I could get by, and sent in my résumé.

And I waited.

Two days later, I called the number on their website to make sure they got it. They did, and they were reviewing it.

And I waited.

The next week I still hadn't heard, so I called again. I was assured that they were still looking at candidates and that I hadn't been rejected.

And I waited.

A few days after that I was getting worried, so I emailed them and asked that, if I had been rejected, could I get some guidance on why?

Many weeks after my initial submission, they finally called me in for a pre-screening. This led to an interview, where I wrote some code and apparently impressed them enough to get offered a position.

Later, I would learn that they only gave me the pre-screen conversation so that I would stop bothering them! Had I not been relentless, they would have ignored my résumé and I would missed the best job I've ever had.
