On Friday, Jan 9, at a little past 09:00, I finished presenting my first talk at a conference. I usually speak at [Columbus Ruby Brigade](http://columbusrb.com) to a captive audience of 30-40 people; CodeMash is a *huge* convention and I wasn't guaranteed to have *anyone* show up! Here's the things I took away from my experience.


### Drop the self deprecation

My sense of humor usually runs toward the self-deprecating, which isn't a problem with folks that know me. At a convention where the majority of folks haven't met you, it's best to put your best face forward. Yes, sell yourself a little. Nobody else is, and this group of strangers might not immediately know that your jokes about how your talk is terrible aren't true.

### No fancy gimmicks

My original talk title was "What to say when they ask about security" and the description involved a narrative about being audited and how you might respond to that.

The talk itself was pretty basic intro to Rails app security, using the OWASP Top Ten as a guide.

I think I may have confused a bunch of people by trying to get gimmicky with my talk title and description. I *definitely* confused folks (including myself) by changing the title to the more simple "Basics of Rails App Security" at the last minute -- the old and new title co-existed on displays and in people's minds.

If you're submitting a talk, give it the most basic title and description you can. Don't be overly specific with it (because the talk *will* change somewhat), but don't try to inject it with character that the talk doesn't have.

### Give your finished talk before the conference

I didn't finish my slides until the day before I was slated to present. I was super nervous about not having them done, and it kinda consumed the first two days of the conference with nervousness. When I did finally finish, a few friends volunteered to listen to a runthrough; they had great feedback for me, but that means that I *still* wasn't done.

### Don't sweat it

My talk was at 08:30 the day after the gigantic afterparty. Attendance at my party was low. I'd kept telling myself and others that this wasn't important, but it still kinda stung. I have to keep in mind that this isn't a personal thing. I submitted a talk to a conference, and it was selected from amongst hundreds of other submissions.

I'll take some of the things I learned giving the talk, refine the presentation a tad, and keep submitting it and other talks.
