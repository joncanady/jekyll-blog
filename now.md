title: What I'm Doing Now
---

I'm living in Columbus Ohio, as I've done all my life, with my wife and two sons.

In the fall of 2015 I left my **Software Development** position to move into management, and so I'm now an **Engineering Manager** at [CoverMyMeds](https://www.covermymeds.com). It's mechanically different from writing code, but the problems that need solved are similar in a way. I love the new challenge, and I can play around with software enough in my spare time to not miss that during the day.

I continue to serve as **Board Member** of the [Columbus Ruby Brigade](http://columbusrb.com). My main tasks there have been coordination with our sponsor and host – also CoverMyMeds – as well as encouraging more beginner-level talks. I have a few things I'd like to accomplish there yet.

My current priorities are, in order:

* Spend time with my kids. This has to be explicitly at the top, because it's easy to forget.
* Spend time with my wife. We haven't got a lot of spare time together, which means we have to prioritize any moment we can get.
* Work. I love it at CoverMyMeds. In October of 2016 I'll have not job hunted for a decade, and I'd like to keep it that way.
* Other family and friends as I can fit in.

In no particular order, here's things I'd like to do but am not doing enough:

* Regular running.
* Regular weight lifting. This and the previous fell off hard after Quentin was born and I'm having trouble working them back into my schedule.
* Gaming. I'm counting tabletop RPGs and CCGs here because I've been out of both for a while, but also I haven't run a poker game in months, either at home or work.
* One new book a month. I'm working through some old favorites now, but I have a backlog to catch up on.

**This page will change if any of the above changes.** Last update was September 3, 2016.
