title: About me
---

I'm Jon Canady, a software developer from Columbus, OH. I started developing software when I was in high school, and was being paid for it by 2003. In late 2006, I had the good fortune to join up with the folks at [Innova Partners](http://innova-partners.com) which in 2009 spun off a company called [CoverMyMeds](http://covermymeds.com) which is one of the greatest businesses I've ever had the pleasure of working at.

I was married in 2008 to my [high school sweetheart](http://kellicanady.com), and in 2012 we had our first son, Alex. I couldn't be more proud of him.
